This project is built in Elm.  I suck at Elm.  Well I guess that's not really fair.  I'm just not experienced with Elm.  
You can look at my source code, but it's ugly!  I read about 25% of the intro tutorial before working on this.

To run/build: 
  * First install Elm.  
  * To run locally, use elm-reactor and look at http://localhost:8000/Bleu-lib.elm
  * To build, elm-make Bleu-lib.elm --output=index.html
